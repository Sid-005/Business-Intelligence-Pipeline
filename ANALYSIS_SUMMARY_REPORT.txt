================================================================================

This comprehensive analysis has identified 5 distinct customer segments with 
unique behavioral patterns and preferences. The combination of RFM analysis, 
K-Means clustering, and association rule mining provides actionable insights 
for targeted marketing, product bundling, and customer retention strategies.

Key strategic priorities include:
1. Protecting and growing the high-value electronics customer base (Cluster 0)
2. Implementing the identified product bundle strategy
3. Re-engaging dormant customers through personalized campaigns
4. Expanding cross-selling opportunities across customer segments

With disciplined execution of the recommended strategies, the business can 
expect to achieve 10-13% revenue growth over the next 90 days and establish
